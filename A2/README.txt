Austin Kobayashi

Used 1 late day :(

Key bindings:
 - W / Up = forward
 - S / down = backwards
 - A & D / left & right = rotate
 - < & > = change current speed
 - n = enter A1 advanced mode
 - m = exit A1 advanced mode
 - k = enter A2 advanced mode
 - l = exit A2 advanced mode
 - o = decrease frequency of path finding
 - p = increase frequency of pathfinding
 - b = toggle debugging mode


Creative features:
 - turtle now chases player
 - turtle speed increases as it approaches player 
 - Fish & turtle both use A* pathfinding (had to create a "Sector" class for this to create cells for the path finding)
 - Fish momentum is carried after a debug collision pause
 - Awesome background music
